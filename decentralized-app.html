								A (DAPP) decentralized application, is a software application that runs on a distributed network . 
								It's not hosted on a centralized server, but block-chain ledger. 
								This makes them more robust and sustainable than centralized applications because they 
								are less vulnerable to 3rd party attacks, or take-downs from authorities. 
								DAPPs are far more secure because your data is stored in many different systems, 
								making it much harder to breach. DAPPs utilize redundancy to  &nbsp;</span><span style="color: #e6e6e6;"></span></h2>

<h2 class="major" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #e6e6e6;"> 
	As a company experienced in open-source development CTE specializes in uniting DAPP and open source technology. 
	Combining these technologies results in greater efficiency, giving you a more flexible business model with less upfront costs. 
	Nfy.finance is an example of successful utilization of this principle, bringing these 2 concepts together resulted in greater efficiency saving the company a considerable amount of energy costs.
	 &nbsp;</span><span style="color: #e6e6e6;"></span></h2>
<p></p>
<h2 class="major" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #e6e6e6;"> 
	We opt to use open-source DAPPs at every possible opportunity. 
	Not only are they easier to repair and modify, but if your team fixes or 
	improves the code you will be listed as a contributor! Our company is deeply invested in the values of Liberty, 
	Independence, and Freedom of Movement. As DAPPs do not need to be stored in one restrictive centralized location 
	they facilitate ease of travel, and are ideal for companies that do not have a physical headquarters.

<p></p>
<h2 class="major" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #e6e6e6;"></span>
	Our development strategy is to prioritize function over form, allowing front end work to take a back seat to back end
	 details at the beginning of the development cycle. 
	 We feel that this results in better optimization and greater efficiency. This allows us, and our clients to save as much money and resources as possible. CTE firmly believes that while aesthetics and presentation are vital components to any project, having a smoothly operating system is more important than a beautiful one that operates sub-optimally.
